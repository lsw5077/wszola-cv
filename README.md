# Hello, world!

My name is Lyndsie, and I'm an ecologist who cares about making the world better. I do research to learn new things about the natural world, and then make R projects that help people use my discoveries (and others'!) to make better decisions about using resources and caring for our world. I also work on tools to help us do science better, so that our research can have the maximum scientific and societal impact. If that's interesting to you, check out my cv in the files above.
